    "## 3. Data Checks to Perform\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into exploratory data analysis and preprocessing, it is crucial to perform initial data checks to understand the structure and quality of the datasets. Below are the essential checks to perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Data Integrity Checks\n",
    "- **Missing Values**: \n",
    "  - Check for missing values in each column of the datasets.\n",
    "  - Assess the percentage of missing values to decide whether to impute or drop them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Duplicate Rows**:\n",
    "  - Identify any duplicate rows in the datasets.\n",
    "  - Remove duplicates if they do not add any additional value to the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Column Data Types**:\n",
    "  - Verify that each column has the expected data type (e.g., numerical, categorical, string).\n",
    "  - Convert data types if necessary (e.g., converting dates to `datetime` format).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Statistical Overview\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics**:\n",
    "  - Generate descriptive statistics for numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum).\n",
    "  - Identify anomalies or unusual values (e.g., extremely high/low values).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Categorical Value Distribution**:\n",
    "  - Analyze the unique values and their counts for categorical columns.\n",
    "  - Check for inconsistent or irrelevant categories (e.g., typos or out-of-scope values).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Consistency Checks\n",
    "- **Range Validation**:\n",
    "  - Ensure numerical columns have values within acceptable ranges (e.g., age should be between 18 and 80).\n",
    "  - Validate interdependent columns (e.g., calorie intake should align with activity level).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unique Identifiers**:\n",
    "  - Verify that unique identifier columns (e.g., `user_id`, `food_id`, `exercise_id`) do not have duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Outlier Detection\n",
    "- **Box Plot Analysis**:\n",
    "  - Use box plots to visually detect outliers in numerical columns (e.g., weight, calorie intake, duration of exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z-Score Analysis**:\n",
    "  - Calculate Z-scores for numerical columns to identify values beyond a specific threshold (e.g., ±3 standard deviations).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**:\n",
    "  - Compute the IQR to detect and handle extreme outliers in the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Data Balance\n",
    "- **Class Imbalance**:\n",
    "  - Check the balance of classes in categorical columns (e.g., gender, activity level, food categories).\n",
    "  - Address imbalances using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting (if required for modeling).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Size**:\n",
    "  - Ensure that the datasets have a sufficient number of records for each category or feature value to build robust models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.6 Data Relationships\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis**:\n",
    "  - Compute correlations between numerical columns to identify linear relationships.\n",
    "  - Use heatmaps to visualize the strength and direction of correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Tabulations**:\n",
    "  - Explore relationships between categorical columns using cross-tabulations or group-by operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7 Data Distribution\n",
    "- **Skewness and Kurtosis**:\n",
    "  - Assess the distribution of numerical features to identify skewness and non-normal distributions.\n",
    "  - Apply transformations (e.g., log, square root) if needed for highly skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualization**:\n",
    "  - Use histograms, KDE plots, or bar charts to visualize the distribution of each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.8 Dataset Summary\n",
    "After performing the above checks:\n",
    "- Summarize findings about data quality and integrity.\n",
    "- Create a plan for handling identified issues (e.g., missing values, outliers, inconsistent data types).\n",
    "- Highlight any key observations or insights from the initial data checks.\n",
